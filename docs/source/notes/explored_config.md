# Favored Configuration

Generally, the default configurations are already good enough. If we want squeeze the size of delta models further, you can refer to the following papers.

 - [AdapterDrop: On the Efficiency of Adapters in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11918)
 - [Sparse Structure Search for Parameter-Efficient Tuning(Delta Tuning)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07382)
